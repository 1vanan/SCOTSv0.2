Helper program to check the RungeKutta solver accuracy of the aircraft ode for
some grid points. The computation uses the interval arithmetic based solution of
ODEs implemented in the C++ package vnodelp available at 

http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/vnodelp/


How to use:

1. install the vnodelp package  

2. edit the Makefile and adjust header and library paths

  the current makefile is supposed to be used with vnodelp in combination with
  BIAS/Profil

  If you chose to install vnodelp with Filib++ you need to adjust the makefile
  accordingly

  Note: the MAXORDER number must coincide with the MAXORDER number used in the
  compilation of the vnodelp package

3. the solver accuracy check depends on a variety of different parameters and
you should edit the ode_test.cc to your needs

4. compile ode_test.cc via make
