Helper programs to compute an apriori enclosure of the aircraft ode. The
computation uses the interval arithmetic based solution of ODEs implemented in
the C++ package vnodelp available at 

http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/vnodelp/


There are two programs

  - comp_enclosure.cc

    computes an a priori enclosure valid for all inputs within the given input
    space bounds

  - comp_enclosure_per_input.cc

    computes for each input an a priori enclosure


How to use:

1. install the vnodelp package  

2. edit the Makefile and adjust header and library paths

  the current makefile is supposed to be used with vnodelp in combination with
  BIAS/Profil

  If you chose to install vnodelp with Filib++ you need to adjust the makefile
  accordingly

  Note: the MAXORDER number must coincide with the MAXORDER number used in the
  compilation of the vnodelp package

3. the a priori enclosure depends on the following parameters which you should 
   adjust to your needs

   - the sampling time
   - the state space bounds
   - the input space bounds

4. compile comp_enclosure.cc and comp_enclosure_per_input.cc via make
