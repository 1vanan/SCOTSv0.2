Unicycle_Khepera 


Directions:


I. unicycle.cc

Run this file to generate the synthesized controller to be mounted on the bot.

The platform is hardcoded and the constraint functions are setup with the obstacles.

The target set is defined inside the code and needs to be changed when synthesizing for a different target.

II. unicycle.m

This Matlab file simulates the trajectory taken by the bot from an initial state to reach the target.
