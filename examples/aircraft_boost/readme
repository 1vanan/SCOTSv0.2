An aircraft landing maneuver taken from https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03715 which
uses and ode solver from the boost library with an adaptive step size

0. for a successful execution of the this example you should have 32GB memory
   available

1. install the boost library  www.boost.org

2. compile the aircraft.cc and simulate.cc file   
   
   edit the Makefile and adjust the boot library path

   compile the programs with
   $ make

3. execute 

  $./aircraft

  which produces

  ./controller.scs

4. simulate the closed loop by running

  $./simulate

5. information on the example are found in
