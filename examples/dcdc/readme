Controller synthesis for a DC DC boost converter to enforce a safety
specification

1. Edit the makefile 

  Adjust the compiler to your programming environment

2. Compile the dcdc.cc and simualte.cc file by typing in the command line

  $ make

3. Execute 

  $./dcdc     
  Computes the symbolic model and synthesizes the controller. The result is
  stored in controller.scs.

  $./simulate
  Reads the controller from file and performs the closed loop simulation.

4. Information on the example is found in

  for incrementally stable switched systems”. In: IEEE TAC 55.1 (2010), pp. 116–126.
