Welcome to SCOTS - an open source software tool to compute discrete abstractions
and symbolic controllers!

Please consult the manual in ./manual/manual.pdf for installation instructions,
usage description and background information.

For implementation details please have a look in the C++ documentation ./doc/html/index.html

Bug reports and feature request are happily received at matthias.rungger@tum.de 

REQUIREMENTS:

- The basic implementation of SCOTS is header only. Hence, only a working C++ compiler
  with C++11 support is needed.

  Have a look in the directories 

  ./examples/dcdc/readme
  ./examples/vehicle/readme

  for some examples and compiler options.
