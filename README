Welcome to SCOTS - an open source software tool to compute discrete abstractions
and symbolic controllers!

Please consult the manual in ./manual/manual.pdf for installation instructions,
usage description and background information.


REQUIREMENTS:

- The basic implementation of SCOTS is header only. Hence, only a working C++ compiler
  with C++11 support is needed.

  Have a look in for some examples and compiler options:

  ./examples/dcdc/readme
  ./examples/vehicle/readme


OPTIONAL:

- MATLAB: For closed loop simulation and visualization options

  To compile the mex files, first setup the mex compiler with the MATLAB command

  >> mex -setup C++

  Then, in a terminal, navigate to ./mfiles/mexfiles
  
  - for the compilation of mexStaticController.mex 

    1) edit the MATLABPATH in the makefile 
    2) run in the terminal

    $ make controller

  - for the compilation of mexSymbolicSet.mex you need to 
  - on a terminal naviaget to ./  file, navigate to 

- MATLAB 
  For closed loop simulation and visualization options
