#Welcome to SCOTSv0.2!

**SCOTSv0.2 is currently under development. Although the core
algorithms are stable and usable, the user interfaces might change...**


**SCOTS** is an open source software tool to compute discrete abstractions and symbolic controllers!

Please consult the manual in ./manual/manual.pdf for installation instructions,
usage description and background information.

For implementation details please have a look in the C++ documentation ./doc/html/index.html

Bug reports and feature request are happily received at <matthias.rungger@tum.de> 

Requirements:

* The basic implementation of SCOTS is inlined and header only. Hence, only a working C++ compiler
  with C++11 support is needed.

  Have a look in the directories 

  * ./examples/dcdc/readme
  * ./examples/vehicle/readme

  for some examples and compiler options.
