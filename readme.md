# Welcome to SCOTSv0.2!

**SCOTSv0.2 is currently under development. Although the core
algorithms are stable and usable, the user interfaces might change...**


**SCOTS** is an open source software tool to compute discrete abstractions and symbolic controllers!

Please consult the manual in ./manual/manual.pdf for installation instructions,
usage description and background information.

For implementation details please have a look in the C++ documentation ./doc/html/index.html

Bug reports and feature request are happily received at <matthias.rungger@tum.de> 

### Requirements:

* The basic implementation of **SCOTS** is inlined and header only. Hence, only a working C++ compiler
  with C++11 support is needed.

* The best way to find out about **SCOTS** is to clone the repository 
  
  `$ git clone https://gitlab.lrz.de/matthias/SCOTSv0.2.git`
  
  and run some of the examples in the example directory: 

  * ./examples/dcdc/
  * ./examples/vehicle/

  Have a look in the readme for some info and compiler options.
